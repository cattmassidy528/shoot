            <p>This silly project was intended to be a space-invaders type of game. <br>
                having run out of time long ago, i instead created a portrayal of my painstaking journey<br>
                through javascript. the enemy, a nonsense quote about javascript, appears to move <br>
                at the last second. the score of "javascript" will always be higher than your own, with <br>
                no rhyme or reason as to how it's calculated. with fun little web dev tidbits tossed in <br>
                for the attentive. fun!
                <br><br>
                is it perfect? definitely not, it's not really supposed to be.
